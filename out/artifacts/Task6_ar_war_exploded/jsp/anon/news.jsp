                    A task manager is a system monitor program used to provide information about the processes and programs running on a computer,
                    as well as the general status of the computer.
                    Some implementations can also be used to terminate processes and programs, as well as change the processes priority.
                    In some environments, users can access a task manager by pressing the buttons Control-Alt-Delete.
                    Task managers can display currently running services (processes) as well as those that were stopped.
                    They can display information about the services (such as Process ID and group) if known.

                    Physiological or biological <b>stress</b> is an organism's response to a stressor such as an environmental condition or a stimulus.
                    Stress is a body's method of reacting to a challenge.
                    According to the stressful event, the body's way to respond to stress
                    is by sympathetic nervous system activation which results in the fight-or-flight response.
                    The body cannot keep this state for long periods of time, afterwards the parasympathetic system returns the body's physiological
                    conditions to normal. In humans, stress typically describes a negative condition or a positive condition that can have an impact
                    on a person's mental and physical well-being.
